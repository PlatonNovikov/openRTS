# OpenRTS

## What is this?
This is a small RTS game that i'm developing on C, using raylib for graphics.

## How to run it?
just run `make run`.

## What is implemented?
Almost nothing. Currently you have one unit from the start, that you can send somewhere with a right click. You can also press `u` to make the tile under your cursor impassable to mess around with pathfinding. Also you can control your camera with `wasd` and mouse wheel, tho it's working quite bad.

## What's your plan?
Ideally to make a game, simular to C&C and Red Alert.
